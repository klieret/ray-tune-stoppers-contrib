## üìù Description

[Ray tune][ray-tune] is a tool for scalable hyperparameter tuning for machine learning applications.
For intelligent hyperperameter optimization, trials that are performing inadequately should be stopped early.
Part of this can be done by schedulers such as [ASHA][asha-paper], but additional explicit stopping criteria are useful as well.

For example, a trial that has converged and is no longer producing better results, but is still outperforming all other running trials, will not be stopped by ASHA.
Ray tune currently only provides three different stoppers: a plateau stopper, a maximum iterations stopper, and a timeout stopper.

This module aims to foster a greater variety of community maintained contributed stopping mechanisms.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip3 install rt_stoppers_contrib
```

## üî• Using it

Using any of the stoppers is as easy as

```python3
from rt_stoppers_contrib.no_improvement import NoImprovementTrialStopper

tuner = tune.Tuner(
    tune.Trainable,
    tune_config=...,
    run_config=air.RunConfig(stop=NoImprovementTrialStopper())
)
```

For more information, refer to the [documentation][docs]

## üß∞ Development setup

```bash
pip3 install pre-commit
cd <this repository>
pre-commit install
gitmoji -i
```
